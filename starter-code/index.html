    <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
    <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso, or Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid facedown on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
